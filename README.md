# AlgEvo

Efficient (almost) single file implementations of evolutionary algorithms.

## Implemented Algorithms

- Particle Swarm Optimization (UPSO)
- Gradient-Assisted Particle Swarm Optimization for Constrained Optimization (UPSO-QP)
- Particle Swarm Optimization with Penalties for Constrained Optimization (UPSO-Penalty)
- Particle Swarm Optimization with Gradient Repair Scheme (UPSO-Grad)
- Differential Evolution (DE)
- MAP-Elites (CVT-MAP-Elites)
- Uncertain MAP-Elites (preliminary: works only for noisy objective function, not noisy features)
- Cross Entropy Method (CEM) or Simple Gaussian Evolutionary Strategies
